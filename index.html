    <h2>I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.
        This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese. 
        This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well. </h3>

        <h2>
            Growing up, our family had a tradition of eating lunch every Saturday at our 
            neighborhood’s favorite local Chinese restaurant. And every single Saturday for lunch, 
            I ordered the same thing — egg drop soup and fried rice, my absolute favorites. This 
            restaurant set the bar high for me early when it comes to how amazing fried rice could be. 
            Theirs was always perfectly al dente with slightly crispy edges, full of rich savory flavors, 
            and loaded up with plenty of extra veggies, eggs, and whatever protein sounded good.
